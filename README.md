## Rules Data
There was an exhaustive replication of the book in JSON here: https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd.git. I utilized this, and am working to alter the json structure to be easier to search for everything. https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd/tree/master/json also had a great list of transcribed rules I imported.
